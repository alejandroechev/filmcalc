## Post 1: r/optics

**Title:** I built a free browser-based thin film optics calculator — transfer matrix method, R/T spectra, material library

**Body:**

Built a free web app for thin film optical design. FilmCalc uses the transfer matrix method to compute reflectance and transmittance spectra for arbitrary multilayer thin film stacks.

It includes a built-in material library with n,k dispersion data for common dielectrics (SiO2, TiO2, MgF2, Si3N4), metals (Al, Ag, Au), and substrates (BK7, fused silica). Design your coating layer by layer and see the R/T spectrum update.

Open source and runs in the browser with no install required.

Would love feedback from optical engineers — what materials or features would you need?

## Post 2: r/physics

**Title:** Free thin film optics calculator — transfer matrix R/T spectra in your browser

**Body:**

I built a free browser-based tool for multilayer thin film optics using the transfer matrix method. Define your layer stack, pick materials from the built-in library (data from Palik handbook and RefractiveIndex.info), and compute reflectance/transmittance spectra.

Great for designing AR coatings, mirrors, and filters. No install, no account, runs entirely client-side.

Feedback welcome — especially on what materials to add to the library.

## Post 3: r/engineering

**Title:** Free browser tool for thin film coating design — multilayer R/T spectrum calculator

**Body:**

I'm building free engineering calculators. FilmCalc does thin film optics — define a multilayer stack, select materials, and compute reflectance/transmittance spectra using the transfer matrix method. Built-in material database included.

No expensive optical design software needed. Open source, runs in your browser.

What features would optical coating engineers find most useful?
